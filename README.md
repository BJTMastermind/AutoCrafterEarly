# AutoCrafter Early

This mod adds the Crafter block from the 1.21 update to **1.20.x**.

### What it does

The Crafter automatically crafts whichever crafting recipe is in its inventory. The inventory can be filled by hand or blocks that output their items such as hoppers or dispensers. To craft said recipe, you must supply a redstone signal to the Crafter and the result along with the byproducts (like buckets in the cake recipe) will be passed through the front.

My implementation includes the tick cooldown change.

### Dependencies

Autocrafter Early requires the Fabric Loader and Fabric API.

### When this mod will lose support

When most mods are updated to 1.20.3, the Autocrafter Early mod will lose support. This is because it will no longer be needed with the **experimental toggle**.
